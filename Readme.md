My own implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm after watching [Tech Buddy](https://www.youtube.com/@TechBuddyTR)'s youtube video about it.
The channel owner has done a really great job in explaining the algorithm. His explanation was better than my university lecturer's. 
However, I have mixed some conventions from the course at the university such as taging. It is not that much important detail.
