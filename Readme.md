My own implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm after watching [Tech Buddy](https://www.youtube.com/@TechBuddyTR)'s youtube video about it.
The channel owner has done a really great job in explaining the algorithm. His explanation was better than my university lecturer's. 
However, even though it is not that much important detail, I have mixed some conventions from the course at the university such as taging. Tagging is similar to constructing a table as explained in the video.

In addition to the example in the video, I have also used two another examples from my course notes. They are as follows.
